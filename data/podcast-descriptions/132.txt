Hey everyone! Thanks so much for watching the 132nd episode of the Weaviate Podcast with Thomas van Dongen, head of AI engineering at Springer Nature! Thomas is also the creator of Pyversity, a fast, lightweight library for diversifying retrieval results! Retrieval systems often return highly similar items. Pyversity efficiently re-ranks these results to encourage diversity, surfacing items that remain relevant but less redundant. It implements several popular diversification strategies such as MMR, MSD, DPP, and Cover with a clear, unified API.
